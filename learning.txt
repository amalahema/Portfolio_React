index.js is the  is the entry point of a React application that  renders the root component (App) into the HTML element with the ID of 'root'.
Root element is in the public folder index.html  <div id="root">
App.js file represents a Single Page Application (SPA) structure using React.

App.js file represents a Single Page Application (SPA) structure using React.

In this file, there is a main component called App that serves as the entry point for your React application. 
It imports several components such as About, Header, Footer, Resume, Portfolio, and Contact
useState hook is used. The currentPage state variable is used to keep track of the currently active page/tab. The handlePageChange function is used to update the currentPage state.

The renderPage function checks the value of currentPage and returns the corresponding component based on the active page. If the currentPage is "About," it renders the About component. Similarly, for other pages like "Contact," "Portfolio," or "Resume," the respective components are rendered. If none of the expected values are matched, it defaults to rendering the About component.

The returned JSX structure in the return statement defines the layout of the SPA. It includes the Header component, main element where the active page component is rendered using renderPage, and the Footer component.

Overall, this App.js file demonstrates the structure and logic of a React SPA, where the content dynamically changes based on the selected page/tab.
now using export default App other components can use the functionality of App.js
Each component have own html structure and java script function
In JSX,(Java script xml) you can use curly braces {} to insert dynamic JavaScript expressions. These expressions can include variables, function calls, mathematical operations, and more. The content within the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript and its result is rendered as part of the JSX output.
To deploy react app in Github need to do the following steps:
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
it install gh-pages library in node modules.
it is added as dev dependency in package.json.
second add this in  "homepage": "https://amalahema.github.io/Portfolio_React/",
third  add this  "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" in scripts
now commit eveything to the repo
Afterward npm run deploy in the command prompt
The gh-pages package is a tool used to deploy a static website to a GitHub Pages branch. When you run npm run deploy or yarn run deploy with the appropriate configuration, it typically uses the gh-pages package to handle the deployment process.

Here's a general overview of what happens when you run npm run deploy:

The deploy script in your package.json file is executed.

The gh-pages command is invoked with the -d flag, followed by the path to the build directory. For example:gh-pages -d build
This tells gh-pages to publish the contents of the specified directory (build in this case) to the GitHub Pages branch.

The gh-pages package creates a new branch (typically named gh-pages) in your repository if it doesn't already exist.

The contents of the build directory (usually containing the compiled and optimized files of your React app) are copied to the gh-pages branch.

The gh-pages branch is pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.

Once the deployment process is completed, your React app will be accessible as a static website at the GitHub Pages URL associated with your repository.
When you run the deployment script using gh-pages (e.g., npm run deploy or yarn run deploy), the gh-pages package will automatically create the gh-pages branch if it doesn't already exist.

The gh-pages branch is a special branch that GitHub Pages uses to serve the static content of your website. The contents of the build directory (typically the build folder) are copied to this branch during the deployment process. Once the gh-pages branch is created and pushed to the remote repository, GitHub recognizes it as the source for your GitHub Pages site.

The gh-pages package simplifies the deployment process by automatically creating and updating the gh-pages branch for you. This allows you to easily deploy your React app or static website to GitHub Pages without having to manually create and manage the branch yourself.
Now go to gitrepo you find gp-pages.
Settings=>Pages=>select gppage
Now your react ready to deploy
how to run the portfolio 
npm start
